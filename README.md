## Built With

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Design Justifications

I chose the React as my web front-end frameword. It provide the component concept that each component can be used multiple times. I have implemented the RESTful API using Node and Express. I chose the skyblue as my web color scheme. Blue is the color of the sky and sea. It is often associated with depth and stability. It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth, and heaven. I chose defualt sans serif font. They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or minimalism.
